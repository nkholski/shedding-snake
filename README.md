# Shedding Snake js1024

Shedding Snake is a contribution to [js1024](https://js1024.fun/), an annual javascript golfing competition with a max size of 1kb (1024 bytes), no shim category. The minfied build is exactly 1024b of which 50 bytes is html and 974 bytes js.



*Entire code base of 1024 bytes:*

## About

Eat apples to grow and shed your skin. Avoid colliding with yourself or skin waste or you'll die. Try to beat the hiscore! Can you reach 25? (Not me ðŸ˜œ)
Controls: WASD or Arrow keys.

## Features that ate bytes

1024 is actually more than enough for a snake game. The extra bytes went into: The snake shed it skin each time it grows. Rotate snake face to current direction. Title screen. Skin pattern and  emojis :-). Score and hiscore.

## How to run

Open the html-file in a modern browser. You can probably just double click it.

## How to build

The script has been minified in three steps. There is no universal solution. For a long time uglify had better results, but I got the smallest builds by running Terser first then Uglify (described below). In the final release I only used Terser though since Uglify would actually increase the size if run on the terser minification.

1. Custom node script
   Run `node shorten-stuff.js` in the src folder.
2. [Terser online](https://xem.github.io/terser-online/)
   Paste the generated `shortened-script.js` into terser.
3. [Uglify online](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/)
   Paste the result from terser into uglifyjs.

Create a html `<canvas id=a style="height:99%"/><script>[CODE]</script>` to get an 1kb html-file. Add `<meta charset="UTF-8" />` at top or the emojis will look strange (js1024.fun site already have this meta tag).
